# Samples

the osx/query sample is a simple demo that allows you to enter your username and password to login, run a query and see the results. 
It demonstrates use of Objective-C blocks to make the web services calls on a background thread, and not block the main UI thread.


I also have a number of open source projects that use zkSforce that you can also look at for usage samples
